# Search (Google Clone) - CS50W

## 🎓 Academic Context
This project was developed as part of **CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** (Harvard University) curriculum. The goal was to recreate the front-end design and functionality of Google's search pages (Search, Images, and Advanced Search) using pure HTML and CSS, matching the company's aesthetics as closely as possible.

## ✨ Features Implemented
- **Google Search:** The main query page which redirects to Google's search results.
- **Image Search:** A specialized search page that redirects to Google Image search results.
- **Advanced Search:** A detailed form allowing users to filter by "all these words," "exact phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words."
- **I'm Feeling Lucky:** A button that bypasses the results page and redirects directly to the first search result (using Google's redirect bypass).

## 💻 Tech Highlights
- **CSS Flexbox & Grid:** Used to align elements precisely to match Google's layout.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring input fields and buttons stack or align correctly based on viewport size.
- **URL Parameters:** Configuring GET requests to send the correct query parameters (e.g., `q`, `tbm=isch`, `as_q`) to Google's servers.
