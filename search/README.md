This project is a Google Search Clone using HTML and CSS.

The index.html file is the main page of the Google Search Clone. There are also two additional pages:

1. g_images.html for Google Images, and
2. advanced_search.html for the Advanced Search page.

All styles are defined in a single file, style.css, which contains the styles for all three pages.
